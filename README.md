- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpcoakes
- 👀 Most days I'm working on custom Salesforce solutions using LWC, Apex, JavaScript, and occasionally Aura and Visualforce.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on a birding app using LWC's in Salesforce. https://playful-raccoon-ntkw7c-dev-ed.trailblaze.my.site.com/portfolio/birding-app
- 👨‍💻 I've also just discovered CodeSignal, WOW! Amazing training. I will be happily paying 25 dollars a month to learn more Python, and probably other programming languages.
